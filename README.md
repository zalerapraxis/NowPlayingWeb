Janky tool I wrote up in a couple hours for a friend because literally nothing else worked. Please don't look.

Its purpose is to pull the title of a window from a Youtube (or technically any other music website) page and save it as a local file to be displayed in OBS. 

Only works for Chrome, since that's what my friend uses.
